# Sentiment-analysis-CNN
This project performs sentiment analysis on amazon review dataset, it gives the output as 0(bad) and 1(good). To perform sentiment analysis I have used the bagging method. CNN is being used so that the model can learn on different n-grams. 
The words are converted to word embedding using CBOW algorithm of Word2vec, using Gensim library.
